# 🔧 App Buffering Issue - Debugging Steps

## 🎯 **Problem:**
- App is buffering/loading at startup
- Nothing is showing up on screen
- Possible causes: AuthContext hanging, Supabase connection issues, or navigation problems

## ✅ **Debugging Added:**

### **1. AuthContext Debugging:**
- Added console logs for initialization
- Added error handling for session loading
- Added 5-second timeout to prevent infinite loading
- Added auth state change logging

### **2. AppNavigator Debugging:**
- Added render state logging
- Enhanced loading screen with debug info
- Shows user status and loading state
- Added navigation state logging

### **3. Supabase Debugging:**
- Added client creation logs
- Added URL verification logs
- Added error handling for auth operations

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### **1. Check Console Logs:**
Look for these logs in the console:
```
Supabase: Creating client with URL: https://wuozvggvxlfuushcwdsh.supabase.co
Supabase: Client created successfully
AuthContext: Initializing...
AuthContext: Initial session loaded: true/false
AppNavigator: Render state: { user: true/false, loading: true/false, ... }
```

### **2. Check Loading Screen:**
- Should see loading spinner
- Should see "Loading..." or "Checking onboarding..." text
- Should see debug info: "User: Yes/No | Loading: Yes/No"

### **3. Expected Flow:**
1. **App starts** → Supabase client created
2. **AuthContext initializes** → Checks for existing session
3. **Loading screen shows** → With debug information
4. **Session loaded** → User authenticated or not
5. **Navigation shows** → Auth screen or onboarding/home

## 🚨 **Possible Issues:**

### **1. Supabase Connection:**
- Network issues
- Invalid URL/key
- Supabase service down

### **2. AuthContext Hanging:**
- Session loading never completes
- Auth state change listener not working
- Promise never resolves

### **3. Navigation Issues:**
- AppNavigator not rendering
- Loading state never changes
- Component mounting issues

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes Applied:**

### **1. Timeout Protection:**
- 5-second timeout prevents infinite loading
- App will show content even if auth fails

### **2. Error Handling:**
- Catch errors in session loading
- Graceful fallback to unauthenticated state

### **3. Debug Information:**
- Console logs show exactly what's happening
- Loading screen shows current state
- Easy to identify where the issue is

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**

1. **Check console logs** - Look for the debug messages
2. **Check loading screen** - Should show debug info
3. **Wait 5 seconds** - Timeout should kick in if auth hangs
4. **Report what you see** - Console logs and screen content

**The app should now show debug information to help identify the exact issue! 🔍**
